# Hackathon-day-1
Practice 

STEP 1: Understand the Hackathon Setup
* Before you start coding, understand:
  -> Duration: 36 hours (You’ll need to manage time!)
  -> Team: Usually 2–4 people
  -> Goal: Build a working prototype (not a full app)
  -> Deliverables: Code, Demo, Pitch.

STEP 2: Choose a Problem to Solve
Here are some beginner-friendly problems you can solve:

Idea	Description
🏥 Health App	Patients can book doctor appointments online.
📚 Quiz App	Students take quizzes and get instant results.
🚗 Parking Finder	Show nearest parking areas on map.
💬 Chat App	A simple real-time chat between users.

STEP 3: Plan the App
We’ll build 4 features:
1) Home Page
2) Appointment Booking Form
3) Doctor List
4) Admin Panel to view appointments.

STEP 4: Set Up the Tech Stack
You’ll use:
-> Frontend: React.js
-> Backend: Django (with REST API)
-> Database: PostgreSQL
-> API Integration: Sparrow SMS (for reminders).
